Title: [MR] Stabilize CI/CD and add health checks

Description:

This MR stabilizes CI/CD for the project and adds a health endpoint and smoke tests.

Changes included:
- Add `backend/tests/test_health.py` (unit test for /healthz)
- Update `.gitlab-ci.yml`:
  - lint, pytest, frontend, build, and deploy stages
  - `build-backend-image` job to build & push docker image (requires CI vars)
  - `smoke-test-image` job to pull and health-check the pushed image
  - `deploy-staging` SSH-based manual deploy that supports `DEPLOY_DIR` and runs migrations
- Add `ci/README.md` documenting required CI variables and runner requirements

Checklist (before merging):
- [ ] Add CI variables in GitLab (DOCKER_REGISTRY, DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, CODECOV_TOKEN, DEPLOY_HOST, DEPLOY_USER, SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, DEPLOY_DIR)
- [ ] Ensure GitLab Runner supports DIND or run jobs on runner with docker access
- [ ] Confirm smoke-test / health to pass on pipeline
- [ ] Manual test deploy to staging (run `deploy-staging` job manually)

Notes:
- `deploy-staging` is manual and should be customized to your production/staging workflow.
- If you prefer a different deploy method (Kubernetes, helm), we can replace the SSH job with a helm/kubectl job.

How to run locally:

1. Build dev stack:
